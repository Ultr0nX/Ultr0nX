# Hi there👋, I'm Sunil kumar (aka Ultr0nX)! 

a, SMART CONTRACT SECURITY ENGINEER and BLOCKCHAIN developer.

# About me 

I’m **Sunil Kumar (aka Ultr0nX)** — a Smart Contract Security Engineer and Blockchain Developer with a strong focus on Web3 security, CTFs, and exploit research.

My core interests is to secure the smart contracts by breaking them and building secure decentralized systems . I actively participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, especially in *Blockchain & Cryptography*, where I analyze real-world vulnerabilities, write exploits, and understand attack patterns used in production systems.

**I work extensively with:**

- Solidity for EVM-based smart contracts

- Rust for low-level blockchain logic and security-critical components ( I can be System level engineer too!)

- Web3 security tooling & audit methodologies

### Current Focus

Currently I am Diving deep into Solana ecosystem and Rust programming language . ( This gives happiness and confidence )


I believe in ethical hacking, open-source learning, and hands-on security research . My goal is to build and audit high-performance, secure, and trustless blockchain systems.

What I learn in my journey :
1. learning from the docs is the best resource 
2. If you spend time on it -> it will be in your hand .

*Always learning. Always attacking. Always securing. Is what I love to do .*
