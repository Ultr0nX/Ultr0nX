# Hi, I'm Sunil Kumar (aka Ultr0nX) 👋

Smart Contract Security Engineer & Blockchain Developer with a strong focus on Web3 security, CTFs, and exploit research.

## About Me

I’m **Sunil Kumar (aka Ultr0nX)** — a Smart Contract Security Engineer and Blockchain Developer.

My core interest is to secure smart contracts by **breaking them first** and then building secure, decentralized systems.  
I actively participate in **Capture The Flag (CTF)** challenges, especially in **Blockchain & Cryptography**, where I analyze real-world vulnerabilities, write exploits, and study attack patterns used in production systems.

I strongly believe in **ethical hacking**, **open-source learning**, and **hands-on security research**.

---

## What I Do

- Find and exploit vulnerabilities in smart contracts
- Write PoCs and exploits to understand real attack surfaces
- Analyze protocol design flaws and logic bugs
- Participate in Blockchain & Cryptography CTFs
- Build secure smart contracts by understanding how they fail

## CTF & Security Research

I actively participate in CTF competitions as part of an academic and independent security research team, focusing mainly on:
- Blockchain security
- Cryptography
- Smart contract exploitation

Below are some of my team-based CTF participations and rankings from CTFtime:

## Selected Work / Projects

- **MiniGrep** — A Rust-based CLI tool built by following *The Rust Book*, with a focus on execution flow, error handling, and OS-level understanding
 
- **PrivacyShield** — ZK-Biometric Identity System (In Progress)

    - Developed a Zero-Knowledge authentication system using Circom and SnarkJS to verify biometric identities without exposing raw facial data on-chain.
    - Implemented Binding-Designated Verifier Proofs (BDVP) to mathematically lock ZK-proofs to specific Smart Contract addresses, preventing replay and relay-theft attacks.
    - Engineered a high-performance Rust Relayer and Solidity suite utilizing Poseidon Hashing and BN254 precompiles for gas-efficient, privacy-preserving verification.
- **Writeups** — in my blog [ultr0nX](https://ultr0nx.vercel.app/writeups/)

- More work in the [github](https://github.com/Ultr0nX)

## How I Learn

- I learn directly from official documentation
- I prefer breaking systems over memorizing theory
- If I spend enough time on something, I make sure I truly understand it
- I value depth, fundamentals, and hands-on experimentation

*Always learning. Always attacking. Always securing.*

## Current Focus

- Rust (systems programming, memory safety, performance)
- Solana (smart contracts, runtime internals, security)
- Blockchain security & CTFs
